            Dylan's passion for self education has continued to grow from a life
            long student and now educator. He has released courses on JavaScript
            and Front on Udemy, Scrimba, Thinkster, SkillShare, & Udemy.

            Dylan has a lot of courses he is proud of, but his 100 Challenges
            Series is his favorite where he always gives 100 problems or
            learning objectives for his students to master.
